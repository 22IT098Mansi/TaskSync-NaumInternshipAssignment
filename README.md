# TaskSync

**TaskSync** is a full-stack task management application developed as an assignment for **Naum Systems**. The application enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks with features such as user authentication, task creation, editing, deletion, priority assignment, and completion tracking. TaskSync offers a modern, responsive user interface with dark mode support, secure authentication, and a robust backend API. The project demonstrates best practices in full-stack development, including RESTful API design, JWT-based authentication, password security, and a clean, user-friendly frontend experience.

## üìù Technical Details

- **Password Validation:** Registration enforces strong passwords (min 6 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 special symbol).
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens are used for all protected routes. Tokens are stored in localStorage and sent in the `Authorization` header.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/users/register` ‚Äî Register a new user
  - `POST /api/users/login` ‚Äî Log in and receive a JWT
  - `GET /api/tasks` ‚Äî List tasks (with optional `status` filter)
  - `POST /api/tasks` ‚Äî Create a new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` ‚Äî Update a task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` ‚Äî Delete a task

- **Dark Mode:** Fully supported via Tailwind and custom UI components.
- **Error Handling:** All forms provide user-friendly validation and toast notifications for errors and successes.
